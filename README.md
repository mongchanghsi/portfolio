## Responsive Portfolio - Personal Project
Live Website: https://ericmong.herokuapp.com/

### Inspiration
As I am currently training for my front-end development skills, I find this an opportunity to develop my own portfolio website and revise some of the concepts I have learnt. This portfolio is responsive and is developed using HTML, CSS, Javascript and ReactJS.
